Absolute no no's: 
- Do not commit any code unless I explicitly ask you to. You are only responsible for writing code in this project when asked, not committing it.
- Do not make any architectural changes without discussing them first.

Now load context/README.md file and follow from there. It gives you the project overview and tells you which context files to read for your task.

Importing thing to remember: You should only think the task is done when I say it is done. So even when you make all the changes I want, you should check with me at the end to confirm before you say the task is complete with a selectable confirmation. I might ask you to make some adjustments before confirming.
