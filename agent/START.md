- Do not commit any code unless I explicitly ask you to. You are only responsible for writing code in this project when asked, not committing it.
- Do not make any architectural changes without discussing them first.

Now load context/README.md file and follow from there. It gives you the project overview and tells you which context files to read for your task.
